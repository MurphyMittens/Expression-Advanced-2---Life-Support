# The Advanced Research Laboratory Of Systematics [T.A.R.L.O.S.]

The Advanced Research Laboratory Of Systematics - A Garry's Mod Project


This project will contain Garrysmod - Expression Advanced 2 code for a variety of life support components in the game.

I've always loved the Life Support and Resource Distribution addons 
in Garrysmod, but I want to create my own version using the in-game E2/EA2


Why am I doing this?
For fun, also GitHub. I want to learn the workflow of GitHub while creating my project. Maybe I can has the smarts instead of using Dropbox. I've been coding in C++, but never got to the point where I really did something about it.



--Project vision--
->In Garrysmod, take for example sb_gooniverse or any spacebuild map.
-->Satellite(s) flying around the center of a planet
--->Batteries hooked up to solar panels on satellite(s)
---->The "sun" is in a fixed point, according to the skybox
----->If solar panel is not facing the "sun" vector position, then its not generating the energy at full potential
------>If batteries are consuming more than panels are generating, it will not be able to send information between planets
------->Base on a planet will communicate with satellite, which will transfer messages around
-------->Base is powered by generators
--------->Generators can only run on resources found on arbitrary vector positions

----------->How many different components will I create?
            I dont know, until I get bored. I will try to make it as realistic as possible, but I we'll see how far I can stretch it
            

Updates? When I got time
